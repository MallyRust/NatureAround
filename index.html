            <p> Statistics created by NASA state that global temperatures have risen by 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, which is directly linked to a reduction in Arctic ice of 13.3% per decade.
                The effects of climate change are widespread, as it will cause issues with deforestation, water supplies, oceans and ecosystems.</p>

            <h3>Water pollution</h3>
            <p> On a global scale, 2 million tons of sewage, agricultural and industrial waste enters the world’s water every day.
                Water pollution can have harmful effects outside of contamination of the water we drink. It also disrupts marine life, sometimes altering reproductive cycles and increasing mortality rates.</p>

            <p> Current estimates state that the planet is losing 80,000 acres of tropical forests per day.
                This results in loss of habitat for many species, placing many at risk and leading to large-scale extinction. Furthermore, deforestation is estimated to produce 15% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

            The World Health Organization has found that 80% of people living in urban areas are exposed to air quality levels deemed unfit by the organization.
            It is also directly linked to other environmental issues, such as acid rain and eutrophication. Animals and humans are also at risk of developing a number of health problems due to air pollution.</p>

      <p>     The average person produces 4.3 pounds of waste per day. Much of this waste ends up in landfills, which generate enormous amounts of methane.
        Not only does this create explosion hazards, but methane also ranks as one of the worst of the greenhouse gases because of its high global warming potential.</p>

    <h3>Environmental issues in my country</h3>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1100">
    <p>
        I live in Uzbekistan, a country situated in Central Asia. One of the most serious eco problems here is <b>the evaporation of the Aral sea. </b> <br>
The Aral Sea is used to be unique, beautiful and one of the largest water reservoirs in the world, also was a region with a wide variety of flora and fauna. Moreover, it played an important role in the development of the region's economy, in ensuring employment of the population, and in the formation of a stable social infrastructure. 
The sea also served as a climate-adjusting reservoir and mitigated the sharp weather fluctuations throughout the region.<br>
But nowadays it is a new salt desert and on the verge of complete disappearance.  In 1960 the problem of the Aral Sea arose and took on alarming proportions as a result of thoughtless regulation of the major rivers of the region- the Syrdarya and the Amudarya.
The significant growth of the population living in this area, the scale of urbanization and intensive development of lands, the construction of large hydro-technical and irrigation facilities on the watercourses of the Aral Sea basin in the past, without taking into account the environmental consequences, created the conditions for desiccation of one of the most beautiful reservoirs on the planet.<br>
A direct consequence were dramatic climate change, ecosystem was severly degraded, wild life habitat was destroyed, also over 90 days a year there are sandstorms, which spread about 100 million tons of dust and poisonous salt into the atmosphere.
