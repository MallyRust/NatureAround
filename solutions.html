              <h3>You can make your home safer by creating your own cleaning products</h3>
              <p><br><br>
                <p> It might sound strange, but you probably already have everything you need to make your home sparkle again. For example, lemons are great for cleaning and freshening up dirty surfaces. Their antibacterial qualities mean they work really well on kitchen countertops, and the juice gets rid of water marks and limescale from your taps and shower curtains. 
                 <br><br>
                 Vinegar is also antibacterial, and it’s great for eliminating bad odors. Just mix some white vinegar with an equal amount of water, and there you are – you now have a fantastic kitchen cleaning solution! The vinegar will also prevent any mold from growing in your refrigerator. And it’s perfect for getting your glassware sparklingly clean. Just use some white vinegar in your dishwasher instead of the rinse aid. 
                 <br><br>
                 Baking soda can also help you make a natural cleaning solution. Mix it with lemon juice, and you’ve got a great cleaner for dirty dishes. Or add a cup of baking soda to your next white laundry load to make your whites even brighter. For best results, mix the baking soda with your usual cleaning detergent. 
                 <br><br>
                 Finally, if you’re looking for a natural yet effective way to remove stains from the bathroom, then your answer could again be – baking soda! This time, just mix it with some white vinegar.
                 <br> <br>
                 If you need extra motivation to make your own cleaning products, then just consider the environmental impact of all those shop-bought cleaners. Shockingly, every plastic spray bottle you buy takes two centuries to decompose</p>

    <h3> Fight against food waste<br>
    Several ways to use leftover ingredients</h3>
<p>
   <b> Got a carrot going spare? Eat it for breakfast</b>
<br>
Grate 1 large carrot into a bowl, add 50g rolled oats, 4 tbsp apple juice or milk, 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon and 2 tbsp chopped apricots or raisins. Mix well, then chill overnight. To serve, mix in 50g natural yogurt and top with chopped walnuts.
<br> <br>
<b>Freeze those browning bananas</b>
<br>
Bananas freeze really well, so as soon as you see those brown spots, peel then pop into freezer bags. Add them frozen to smoothies, or defrost and mash for a delicious banana cake or banana pancakes.
<br><br>
<b>Cook your salad leaves </b>
<br>
If your leaves are starting to turn limp, stir-fry iceberg or Gem lettuce with some sesame oil, garlic and soy sauce for a speedy Asian-inspired side dish.
<br><br>
<b>Make your own chilli oil</b>
<br>
Fill a sterilised jam jar halfway with a mild olive oil, add a thyme sprig and 1 garlic clove. Every time you have a spare chilli, thinly slice and add to the oil, topping up with oil to cover. The chillies will keep for months. Add them to curries, or drizzle the oil over pizzas, salads or pasta.
<br> <br>
<b>Whizz up old bread</b>
<br>
Whizz up leftover herbs and stale bread in your food processor to make herby breadcrumbs, then freeze. Use from frozen for a great coating for fried or baked fish, or add cheese and make a topping for baked mushrooms.
<br> <br>
<b>Fruit & nut couscous</b>
<br>
Gather all the leftover dried fruit and nuts from your Christmas recipes, cut into small pieces and add to cooked and fluffed-up couscous along with fresh herbs and lemon juice. Serve with lamb chops or grilled chicken.
<br> <br>
<b>Mixed root veg coleslaw</b>
<br>
Use a combination of leftover uncooked carrots, celeriac and beetroot with shredded cabbages or sprouts. Mix with a dressing of mayonnaise, lemon juice and a little mustard, and serve with cold meats, cheeses and jacket potatoes.
<br> <br>
<b>Egg shells as a plant fertilizer</b>
<br>
And of course, the shell, which is rich in minerals (fertilized with calcium, copper, zinc, silicon, phosphorus, iron, manganese and other substances), can become excellent calcium. It is easy to grind it into powder and fertilize the soil with it - about 300 grams of such fertilizer is needed per square meter.
